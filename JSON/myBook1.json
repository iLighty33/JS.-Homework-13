    "Title": "The Stand",
    "YearOfRelease": "1978",
    "Description": "The original draft for The Stand was so long that printing presses were literally unable to handle it, forcing King to cut out a large chunk of the book, the story of a super virus called Captain Trips that wipes out about 99 percent of the planet. The survivors come together in two camps and wage the ultimate war of good against evil. It's a crazily ambitious book, but King executed it flawlessly. The uncut version came out in 1990, and four years later ABC turned it into a miniseries. There's been talk for years about a proper movie – or even a series of movies – but neither has yet to happen."
